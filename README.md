if npm doesn't work
use command line with sudo
# sudo docker build . -t craftcode/cra-docker
# docker run -p 8080:80 craftcode/cra-docker --name react

# to stop docker
##   sudo  docker rm -f react


Check that nginx is working http://localhost:8080/
Run the app with:
http://localhost:8080/index.html
you'll be redirected to the app
